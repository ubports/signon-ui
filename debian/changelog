  * Use a MainView and pull in the UserAgent logic used in the Browser
    component. Using the correct useragent fixes things like facebook
    suggesting users should install the facebook app for iphone (LP:
    #1235259). (LP: #1235259)
  * Allow overriding the QML files used by placing them in
    /usr/share/signon-ui/qml If there is a webview.qml file in that
    directory, load it instead of using the one built into the
    resources. This is useful for debugging QML only changes on the
    device without needing to rebuild and install signon-ui. It is
    important to note, when overriding them you need to copy include the
    .qml and .js files into that directory. .

  * Allow LIBDIR and LIBEXECDIR to be overridden; install in multiarch
    path; set LIBEXECDIR=LIBDIR .

  * Bump build dependency for XEmbed support .
  * Allow the request to be cancelled from the UI. Clients can provide a
    QML component to be used in order to create the authentication page,

  [ phablet ]
  * Add some more logic for the webview, based on Ubuntu.Browser for better 
    support on phablet

  [ Ken VanDine ]
  * Optionally use WebKit2 in Qt5 Add a configuration option ("qmake
    CONFIG+=no-widgets") to disable using the QtWidgets based QWebView
    and use QtQuick's WebView, which is based on WebKit2. Another
    configuration option ("CONFIG+=force-foreign-qwindow") can be used
    to enable window embedding/reparenting with Qt5, which otherwise
    would only be enabled with Qt 5.1 or later. Note that the "no-
    widgets" option is not activated in debian/rules; that bit should go
    into a separate branch. The WebView implementation is mostly based
    on Ken Vandine's "phablet-rebased" branch; the big difference here
    is that the WebView is opened in a separate process, which is
    spawned by signon-ui with a hacked $HOME variable which will force
    WebKit2 to store all its data (cookies and form completions) into a
    different location depending on the identity being authenticated.
    The process separation is needed in order not to share the same
    WebKit's WebProcess among the WebViews, which would defeat the trick
    of changing $HOME.

  [ Alberto Mardegan ]
  * Use bzr-export to implement the "make dist" command This includes
    the po/Makefile file, which was previously being excluded by
    mistake. . (LP: #1162296)
  * Wait 3 seconds before reporting a page load failure When logging in
    to Google with an Ubuntu SSO account, the browser is briefly
    redirected to a page which fails to load; however, the
    authentication then continues successfully. In order not to stop the
    authentication process, wait three seconds before terminating the
    authentication with an error, and abort the timer if another URL is
    queued. . (LP: #1171853)
  * Cancel fail timer when a load is in progress If a page is loading,
    don't make the request fail. . (LP: #1171853)
  * Implement removeIdentityData signond will call this method when an
    identity is removed or being signed out. .
  * Optionally use WebKit2 in Qt5 Add a configuration option ("qmake
    CONFIG+=no-widgets") to disable using the QtWidgets based QWebView
    and use QtQuick's WebView, which is based on WebKit2. Another
    configuration option ("CONFIG+=force-foreign-qwindow") can be used
    to enable window embedding/reparenting with Qt5, which otherwise
    would only be enabled with Qt 5.1 or later. Note that the "no-

    The process separation is needed in order not to share the same
    WebKit's WebProcess among the WebViews, which would defeat the trick
    of changing $HOME.
  * Runtime detection of browser handler Even if the "use-webkit2"
    option is given at build time, allow using the qtwebkit1 interface
    on xcb. This allows us to use the same signon-ui binary for desktop
    and phone form factors. .
